# 🧠 State Management

The application uses **Cubit** from **flutter_bloc**.

States:

- NoWeatherState
- LoadedWeatherState
- WeatherFailureState

The Cubit is responsible for:

- Fetching weather data
- Managing loading and error states
- Updating the UI automatically
- Changing the application's theme dynamically

# 🌐 API

This project uses:

**WeatherAPI**

https://www.weatherapi.com/

Endpoint used:

```
/forecast.json
```

# 📦 Packages Used

| Package | Purpose |

# 🎨 Dynamic Theme

One of the interesting features of this project is that the application theme changes automatically according to the current weather condition.

Examples:

- ☀️ Sunny → Amber
- ☁️ Cloudy → Blue Grey
- 🌧 Rain → Blue
- ❄️ Snow → Cyan
- ⛈ Thunderstorm → Deep Purple
- 🌫 Fog → Grey

This makes the application feel more dynamic and visually engaging.
